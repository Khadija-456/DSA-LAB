This repository contains various C++ programs that demonstrate recursion through different examples.These programs cover topics such as computing factorials, reversing a string, computing power, and solving mathematical problems like the Ackermann function, binomial coefficients, and prime number checking.

Example 1: Computing Factorial

This example focuses on computing the factorial of a number using recursion.It establishes a base case where the factorial of zero is one and a recursive case that calculates the factorial by multiplying the number by the factorial of the preceding number.

Example 2: Reversing a String

    This example demonstrates string reversal through recursion.It reads characters one by one and prints them in reverse order once a newline character is encountered.

    Example 3 : Computing Power

    This example computes the power of a number using recursion.The base case is when the exponent is zero, returning one.The recursive case involves multiplying the base number by the result of the power function with a decremented exponent.

    Example 4: Computing the Ackermann Function

    This example implements the Ackermann function, which is a classic example of deep recursion.It applies specific recursive rules depending on the values of two given parameters.

    Exercise 1 : Power Calculation

    This exercise recursively computes powers of two up to twenty and displays the results in a formatted manner.

    Exercise 2 : Ackermann Function

    This exercise tests the Ackermann function using specific input values to demonstrate its behavior.

    Exercise 3 : Recursive Number Printing

    This exercise prints numbers in descending order recursively, stopping when a negative number is reached.

    Exercise 4 : Binomial Coefficient

    This exercise computes the binomial coefficient using recursion based on its mathematical formula, demonstrating how combinations can be determined recursively.

    Exercise 5 : Prime Number Check

    This exercise attempts to check whether a number is prime using recursion.However, it lacks complete logic and needs improvement in its divisibility checks.

    Compilation& Execution

    To compile and execute these programs, a C++ compiler such as g++ is required.The source files should be compiled and executed accordingly.The usage of non - standard headers should be avoided or replaced with standard alternatives.

    This collection of programs serves as an educational resource to illustrate the concept and application of recursion in C++.
