C++ STL Code Examples
This repository contains a collection of C++ code examples demonstrating various Standard Template Library (STL) data structures, algorithms, and functionalities. The code snippets cover topics such as vectors, lists, stacks, bitsets, sets, and string manipulations. The examples include both theoretical and practical exercises for better understanding of the STL in C++.

Description of Examples
1. Example 2.1: Random Shuffle with Vectors (STL vector)
This example demonstrates how to randomly shuffle a vector using the random_shuffle() algorithm and print the shuffled elements.

2. Example 12.2: Iterating through a List (STL list)
This example shows how to iterate through a list using front() and pop_front() to remove and access elements.

3. Example 12.3: Random Shuffle with Deque (STL deque)
Similar to Example 2.1 but using deque instead of vector. The elements are shuffled randomly, then accessed using front().

4. Example 12.4: Stack Operations (STL stack with list)
This example demonstrates stack operations (push(), pop(), top()) using a stack container implemented with a list.

5. Example 12.5: Bitset Operations (STL bitset)
A simple demonstration of how to use bitset from the STL to perform bitwise NOT operations and display the result.

6. Example 12.6: Find Element in Vector (STL vector with find())
This example demonstrates how to use the find() algorithm to search for an element in a vector and print its position if found.

7. Example 12.7: Set Union Example (STL set_union())
This example shows how to compute the union of two sets using the set_union() algorithm from the STL and print the result.

8. Exercise 12.8: Fill Functions for Arrays (STL fill() and fill_n())
This exercise demonstrates the use of fill() and fill_n() algorithms to initialize arrays with specific values.

9. Exercise 12.9: Accumulate Operations (STL accumulate())
This exercise demonstrates the use of accumulate() from the STL to compute the sum and product of elements in an array.

10. Example 12.10: Custom Class with Sorting (STL sort())
A custom String class is defined, which supports comparison (<) and sorting of String objects in a vector. The sort() algorithm is used to sort the vector.

11. Exercise 12.11: Word Frequency Counter Using Map (STL map)
This example shows how to use a map from the STL to count the frequency of words input by the user
