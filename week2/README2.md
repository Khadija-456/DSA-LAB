Overview

This project provides various implementations of the stack data structure in C++. The implementations include both fixed-size and template-based stacks, along with applications such as string reversal, balanced parentheses checking, infix-to-postfix conversion, and postfix expression evaluation.

Contents

Example 2.1

A basic stack implementation using an array to store integers. This stack provides fundamental operations such as push, pop, and checking if the stack is empty or full.

Exercise 2.1

An enhanced version of the stack that includes encapsulation. It introduces an additional function to retrieve the top element without removing it.

Exercise 2.2

A stack implementation using characters instead of integers. This version is designed for string manipulations, including reversing strings, checking balanced parentheses, and handling expressions.

Example 2.2 (Template Stack)

A generic stack implementation using templates, allowing the storage of multiple data types such as integers and floating-point numbers. It also supports dynamic memory allocation and template instantiation for different types.

Features

Basic stack operations: push, pop, and peek

Fixed-size stack implementations

Template-based stack for dynamic and flexible data handling

Applications include:

String reversal

Checking balanced parentheses

Converting infix expressions to postfix

Evaluating postfix expressions

Applications

String Manipulation: Reverse strings using the stack data structure.

Parentheses Validation: Check if an expression has balanced parentheses.

Expression Conversion: Convert infix expressions to postfix notation.

Postfix Evaluation: Evaluate postfix expressions using a stack.
