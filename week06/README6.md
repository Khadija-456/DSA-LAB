Linked List Exercises – DSA Lab
This project demonstrates the implementation and usage of singly linked lists in C++ through a series of exercises that explore common operations such as insertion, deletion, stack operations, and string reversal using a linked list.

Overview
The code includes implementations of basic and slightly advanced linked list functionalities divided across three exercises(6.1, 6.2, and 6.3).These exercises are designed to help students understand how linked lists work under the hood and how they can be applied to real - world problems such as reversing a string or managing a stack structure.

Exercise 6.1 – Basic Linked List with Stack Features
This section introduces a templated singly linked list class with methods for pushing, popping, inserting after a specific node, deleting a node, and checking if the list is empty.It mimics the behavior of a stack by implementing push and pop operations.

Exercise 6.2 – Reversing a String Using a Stack
This part uses the previously implemented stack - based linked list to reverse a user - input string.Each character of the string is pushed into the linked list, and then popped out to produce the reversed result.This demonstrates how stacks can be used to solve simple string manipulation problems.

Exercise 6.3 – Linked List with Extended Operations
In this exercise, a non - templated linked list class is implemented with additional features.These include methods to build the list, display it, and remove the first, last, or a specific node by value.It provides more control over the list’s content and structure, showcasing how to manage dynamic memory effectively in a singly linked list.
